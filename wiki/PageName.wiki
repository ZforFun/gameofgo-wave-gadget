= Introduction =

By using themes you can change the look-and-feel of the gadget. Below you can read, how to use this feature.


= Details =

A theme defines the lookout of the board, stones, etc. As of now, the size of the board also depends on the theme (e.g. 9x9 or 19x19).
To change the theme you have to type the URL of the theme into the edit box above the board. Then you have to press the change button next to it.
If you are in the middle of a game you are not allowed to change to a theme with different board size.

Now we have the following four "standard" themes:

  * http://gameofgo-wave-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/themes/test-theme/
  * http://gameofgo-wave-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/themes/basic-theme/ 
  * http://gameofgo-wave-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/themes/basic-9x9-theme-TEMP/ (this is just temporal, later, when the boardsize is independent on theme, this will be removed)

Anybody can create an own theme. Technically the theme consist of an xml file and a bunch of png files. These should be created and hosted somewhere. If you look at a "standard" theme, you will be able to figure out, what you need to do to create an own theme.
