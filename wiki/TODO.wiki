= Introduction =

This is a simple TODO list.
If a point is done, move it into the "Done" list

= Details =

To Do:

  * Counting mode (with signing stones as dead)
  * Add messages to the UI: e.g. "You can only put a stone on an empty place".
  * Possibility of playing on 9x9 and 13x13 sized boards

Done:

  * Implement players and alternating moves
  * Implement a simple KO-rule 
  * Button First (Instead of Undo-ing to the beginning)
  * Button Last (Instead of Redo-ing to the end)
  * Implement the SGF-parser (in a simple way for the time being)
  * Undo is not smooth on highly filled board 
  * With the [ExampleSGF2 second SFG example] the number of characters in the board description is over 10.000. This can be a lot of bytes. We should try to [Compressed_Game_Representation compress] the board size...
