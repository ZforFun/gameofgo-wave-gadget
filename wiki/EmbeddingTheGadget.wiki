#summary How to add the go-gadget to a wave
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured


 * Go to the blip (those selectable parts of a wave) into which you want to add the go-gadget
 * Go to edit mode (e.g. with control-e)
 * Press the "puzzle-piece" toolbutton (its tooltip is "Add Gadget by URL")
 * Write the following URL into the input field appearing: http://gameofgo-wave-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gameofgo-wave-gadget.xml
 * Enjoy it ;-)

The given URL is the trunk-version, so it is the most stable gadget-version.

Important remark!: save your position often, because we are developing the stuff and so sometimes we overwrite the trunk-version with a newer one, which may not be compatible with the old one. You can use the "Export to SGF" link, and you can copy the content of the popup window appeared.
